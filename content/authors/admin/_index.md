**About me**

I am a Bioinformatician at the Moskowitz Lab at The University of Chicago, where I apply advanced computational methods to understand complex biological systems. My research focuses on bulk RNA-seq analysis in the context of developmental biology, with particular emphasis on Trisomy 21/Down syndrome, cardiac development, and hedgehog signaling pathways.

With expertise in iPSC cortical neuron differentiation and neural crest cell development, I employ cutting-edge bioinformatics tools to investigate gene expression patterns and molecular mechanisms underlying developmental processes.

**Technical Expertise**

* **RNA-seq Analysis:** DESeq2, maSigPro, edgeR, limma
* **Data Processing:** VST normalization, CPM filtering, apeglm shrinkage
* **Pathway Analysis:** GSEA, GO term enrichment
* **Visualization:** pheatmap, ggplot2, z-score winsorization
* **Programming:** R, Bioconductor
* **Workflow Management:** Nextflow, nf-core pipelines
* **High Performance Computing:** SLURM job scheduling

**Research Focus**

My current research integrates bioinformatics approaches to explore:
* Gene expression dynamics in developmental disorders
* Molecular mechanisms of cardiac development
* Hedgehog signaling in neural development
* Temporal gene expression patterns using time-series RNA-seq
* Chromatin accessibility landscapes via ATAC-seq analysis
