<div class="about-section">

## Welcome

I am a **Bioinformatician** at the **Moskowitz Lab** at The University of Chicago, where I apply advanced computational methods to understand complex biological systems. My expertise lies in **bulk RNA-seq analysis** within developmental biology, with particular focus on **Trisomy 21/Down syndrome**, cardiac development, and hedgehog signaling pathways.

---

## Research Mission

My work bridges computational biology and developmental genetics to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying human development and disease. I specialize in analyzing gene expression patterns in **iPSC-derived cortical neurons** and **neural crest cells**, employing cutting-edge bioinformatics tools to translate complex genomic data into biological insights.
