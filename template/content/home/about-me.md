I am a Bioinformatician in the Ivan Moskowitz Lab at the University of Chicago, Department of Pediatrics and Human Genetics. My research focuses on studying Trisomy 21, Hedgehog signaling in regulation of developmental timing, and gene regulatory networks involved in atrial fibrillation and heart failure.
