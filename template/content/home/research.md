My research focuses on understanding gene regulatory networks governing disease pathogenesis during development. I use genomics techniques including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C, Micro-C, scRNA/snRNA-seq, H3K27ac ChIP, and spatial transcriptomics.

**Current Research Areas:**
- Investigating gene regulatory networks in cardiac development and disease
- Analyzing Trisomy 21 effects on developmental timing
- Studying Hedgehog signaling pathways in heart development
- Computational analysis of multi-omics datasets
- Single-cell transcriptomics of cardiac cell populations
