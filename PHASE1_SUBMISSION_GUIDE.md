Dear [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request a small update to my profile on the [Moskowitz Lab/Department] website.

I've recently launched my professional portfolio website at https://zohebkhan1.github.io to showcase my research and bioinformatics work at the lab. Would it be possible to add this link to my profile on the lab's people page?

The link could be added as:
- "Personal Website" or

This would help colleagues and potential collaborators find my work and publications more easily.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Zoheb Khan
