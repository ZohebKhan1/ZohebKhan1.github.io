## üéØ Priority 1: Lab Website Request

### Email to Lab Administrator/PI
```
Subject: Profile Update Request - Zoheb Khan Personal Website

Dear Dr. Moskowitz / [Administrator Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to request a small update to my profile on the Moskowitz Lab website.

I've recently created a professional portfolio website (https://zohebkhan1.github.io) that showcases my bioinformatics research, publications, and current projects at the lab. This site serves as a comprehensive hub for my academic work and makes it easier for potential collaborators to learn about my research focus on Trisomy 21, Hedgehog signaling, and gene regulatory networks.

Would it be possible to add a link to this website on my profile page on the lab website? This would help strengthen our lab's online presence and make our research more discoverable.

Suggested link text: "Personal Website" or "Zoheb Khan - Research Portfolio"

Thank you for considering this request. I'm happy to provide any additional information needed.

Best regards,
Zoheb Khan
Bioinformatician, Moskowitz Lab
University of Chicago
